The general theory I wanted to pursue here is that, every season many MLB teams either benefit or struggle
greatly from the result of pure luck. If this luck could be quantified in the first half of the season, then
these teams would undoubtedly experience some regression toward the mean in their fortunes for the remainder
of the season. As a result, a more accurate prediction could be made for how the standings might shake out
for the playoffs. The model was tested and altered using data from each of the previous ten seasons, although
I still wanted to make careful reasoning before deciding how to quantify certain aspects of luck in order to
avoid manufacturing a low p-value, when in truth this model would not be as helpful for future seasons. Even
so, with 24,300 games being analyzed in this program, I am not particularly worried about that potential issue.

There were 3 aspects of luck I could identify with the data given by retrosheet

1. Win-Loss record in close games, specifically 1 run, 2 run, and extra inning games
    Since scoring in baseball is essentially independent of the other teams offense (unlike almost all other
    team sports), teams that are winning most of their close games are getting lucky to some degree.

2. Strength of schedule faced before 7/4 compared to the strength thereafter
    A team that played a lot of good teams before July fourth and will play worse teams for the remainder of
    the season will predictably perform better.

3. Runs scored by the team in games as a result of defensive errors
    Errors are randomly distributed in a game, and I hypothesized that many of them were flukes given the
    talent in the league. Therefore teams that were getting runs at the hands of fortunate mistakes by the
    opposition had an inflated record.
